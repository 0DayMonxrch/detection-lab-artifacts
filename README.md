This repository contains behavior-driven detection scenarios designed and validated in Wazuh, aligned with MITRE ATT&CK. 

Each detection includes structured threat modeling, baselining, correlation logic, validation methodology, and adversarial simulation.

---
### Design Philosophy

Each detection scenario follows a structured lifecycle:
- Threat behavior definition
- Telemetry and field analysis
- Detection hypothesis
- Correlation logic design
- False positive assessment
- Controlled validation
- Iterative rule refinement

All scenarios are tested using real log generation rather than synthetic injection.
